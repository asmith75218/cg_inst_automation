# To add a new instrument module, duplicate _inst_mod_template.py (this file) and rename
# it to {instrument}.py (no spaces) with the name of the instrument. The name you give the
# file is the name that will appear in this program's interactive menus.
# 
# Rename {proc1}, etc. with the names of procedures that will appear in the instrument's
# interactive menu. Add your code to this file below to define these procedures.
# 
# Module is ready for use.
